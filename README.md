Role game is a homework that I had, but now I want to make it very complex and with all python functions possibles.

## Installation

you can download the .py and the requirement.txt file to star seeing the game (and the issues)

## Usage

Start the python file using python3 and start playing.
It start telling you how lucky you feels and then begin the story.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. I'm literary beginning to do this kind of thing, so if you can teach me who can I correct my GitHub space and that kind of thing, I'd be very happy.
